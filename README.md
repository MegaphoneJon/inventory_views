Inventory Views
===============

Adds new content types to Civi to track contracts, servers, and websites, integrating with CiviCRM with client tracking.

In the future, this feature will enable a view for Ansible to use this as a dynamic inventory source.

To get this working, you must first enable CiviCRM Views integration: **CiviCRM Administer menu » System Settings » CMS Database Integration**.
